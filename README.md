## Project Overview
---
Overview:
This project explores the diverse backgrounds of students enrolled in the Data Analysis course at SkilHarvest Academy. Surveys were conducted to gather information on age, gender, education, marital status, occupation and location. The analysis of this data unveils diversity in age groups, geographic locations, prior education levels, and more. The goal is to identify any underrepresented groups and understand how student backgrounds influence their learning needs. The report presents key findings using visual charts and graphs. These insights will inform enhancements to the course, such as updating teaching approaches and providing tailored support resources, to ensure an enriching experience for all students, regardless of their demographic profile. Ultimately, this study aims to deeply understand student demographics to optimize the effectiveness of the Data Analysis course at SkilHarvest Academy.
